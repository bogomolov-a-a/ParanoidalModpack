[mod-setting-description]
osm-pumps-enable-power=If enabled offshore pumps will require electricity to operate\n\n[color=#fffe93]NOTE:[/color] The change in internal energy of a system (Î”Usystem) is equal to the difference between the heat supplied to the system (Q) and the work (W) done by the system on its surroundings, hence, it is in no way possible, either by mechanical, thermal, chemical, or other devices, to obtain perpetual motion.
osm-pumps-power-priority=If enabled offshore pumps will have the highest level of priority over the electric network (same as laser turrets)\n\n[color=#fffe93]NOTE:[/color] It only works if power requirements are enabled.
osm-pumps-burner-offshore-pump=If enabled the basic offshore pump will use burnable fuel instead of electricity\n\n[color=#fffe93]NOTE:[/color] It only works if power requirements are enabled.
osm-pumps-enable-ground-water-pumpjacks=If enabled will be possible to research and build ground water pumpjacks for pumping water out of the ground\n\n[color=#fffe93]NOTE:[/color] Ground water pumpjacks ALWAYS require power to work regardless of power requirement setting.
osm-pumps-landfill-goes-boom=If enabled landfill placed underneath offshore pumps will destroy them
osm-pumps-boiler-start-water=If enabled boilers will be placed down with a little amount of water inside to jumpstart power production.
